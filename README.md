# FitCheckApp

## INSTALLATION

1. Follow the CSCI 40 slideset on how to setup a virtual environment and install 
the necessary dependencies (Django, dotenv, etc.). This is just archived in Canvas.

2. When installing dependencies, **be sure to include psycopg2-binary.** (pip install psycopg2-binary)
This is necessary for getting PostgreSQL to work.

3. Instead of doing startproject, **clone this repo into the virtual environment folder.** Don't forget to do the necessary steps for making the .env file.

4. To add your section, **make an app.** This means there should be 5 apps in total.
